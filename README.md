# layl-pwa
Layl v2

Re-write of https://github.com/mr-islam/layl to fix deep bugs, enjoy a new framework, etc.

See a recent test version: https://layl-beta3.netlify.app/

## Status
Main features done, testing extra features. Design (dark theme, responsivity) and copy still to go!~

## Development

I work on this as a hobby during my freetime, so my full effort & focus goes to actual updates that benefit *users* and thorough bug-testing. Thus documentation and the issues board on GitHub are not updated regularly.
 
Please contact me if some code is unclear, or if you would like to contribute so I can share development plans. I would be more than happy to update the project plans or code documentation as soon as there are people interested in contributing‚Äîuntil then, I'm full-focus on actual improvements üëç.
