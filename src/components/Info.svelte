The Islamic night starts at Maghrib and lasts until Fajr. This app uses official calculation methods from around the world, but it may be inaccurate for some locations.
</p>

<p>

So, please <strong>double-check the Maghrib and Fajr times</strong> given by this app—if they are correct then the other times will also be correct. Safeguard your worship by keeping enough time before or after the times given by any app.

These warnings aren't pretty, but they're part of responsible app development. May Allah accept our worship, <em>ameen</em>.
